### Solution

To solve this level, we first log into the natas7 application using the credentials provided above.

![natas7-1](https://securitytimes.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/7-10-2017-3-56-13-pm.png?w=663)

We can see that the application has a couple of links to the Home page and the about page. The application also provides a hint in a comment which reads ‘**hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8**‘. Therefore, if we can somehow navigate to this page, we might be able to read the password.

By clicking around on the application, we can see that the application submits the page to load by using a get parameter ‘**page**‘. When we click on home, the application takes us to **http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=home** and similarly we are taken to **http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=about** for the about page.

This application behavior gives us an idea that if we change the input for the get variable, we might be able to open a different page that the application owner probably did not intend for us to be able to. After changing the page variable to the destination provided in the hint ‘**/etc/natas_webpass/natas8**‘, we can see the content of that page which is the password for the next level.
